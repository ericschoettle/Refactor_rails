# README

E-commerce site. Uses `bcrypt` and `materialize`. There's a seed file. Set up your own admin. If you have questions, I'll be in Bali with no email. Ask someone else.

To set up:

* ```bundle```
* ```rake db:setup```
* Navigate to localhost:3000 in your web browser. 

* Sorry, didn't get around to tests. It mostly works. There might be a few bugs.
